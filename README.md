Hi,

My name is Roderick Fitzgerald and this is my repo-clone-exercise.
The image below is my version of Takayuki Yamaguchi's Irako Seigen from the anime, Shigurui: Death Frenzy.
My about.md/about.html files have this piece of art with a link attached to it redirecting to the anime's wikipedia page.
If you are squeamish, it is NOT for you. 
Enjoy!
